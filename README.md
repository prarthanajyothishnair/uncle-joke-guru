### Project Description
The Kerala Uncle Joke Detector is a lighthearted web app that “analyzes” your jokes and tells you if they have true Kerala uncle vibes — complete with coconut-flavored humor and playful verdicts. It’s totally useless, completely random, and 100% for laughs.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
This web app “solves” the *completely imaginary* problem of people being unsure whether their joke qualifies as a **true Kerala Uncle joke** — because obviously, society cannot function without such critical classifications.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We’re “solving” it by letting users paste their joke into the app, then instantly giving them a **random, overconfident verdict** — complete with emojis and Kerala-themed sass — so they can finally rest easy knowing whether their joke meets the legendary uncle standard.

The Kerala Uncle Joke Detector, a playful web app designed to analyze and classify jokes in the style of classic "uncle jokes" from Kerala culture. The interface invites users to type or paste their joke into a text box—for example, “Why did the coconut go to therapy? Because it had too many issues to crack!”—and then click the “Detect Uncle Joke” button. The app humorously claims to use “coconut wisdom” to scientifically verify the joke’s uncle-ness, blending local humor with a lighthearted design in a gradient background of green and orange hues.

The Kerala Uncle Joke Detector web application with a Malayalam joke entered in the text box. The user has typed “Devamme moorkkane anallo chavuttiyath!” which roughly translates to “Oh God, you kicked the fool, didn’t you!”—a typical style of humorous or scolding remark popular in Kerala’s uncle jokes. Below the input field, there are two buttons: Detect Uncle Joke to analyze the entered text, and Try Another to reset the form. The interface features a friendly green and orange gradient background and highlights the app’s promise to “scientifically verify your uncle jokes,” blending regional humor with a playful design.
